Thoughts and whimsy

I guess that this is the official start of my coding journey. I grew up in the '90s and it's weird to me to see my actual name attached to professional code. Most of my friends that code still do so under a pseudonym. I'm really excited to embark on this journey, becasue it leads to tomorrow. Tomorrow is a world filled with opportunity and the ability to fulfill one's dreams. My dream is to work with 3D protein folding. I've seen a few articles that are using machine learning to attempt to understand the process, and I gravitate towards that as a solution to a problem we've seen in the Discovery Age. As we move in the Information Age, the most important thing is seeing and understanding connections, which is the issue posed by 3D protein folding. The connection's there aren't always energetically advantageous, and seem to be unpredictable. I think a pattern might emerge if enough proteins' connections are processed. This ability is beyond the average person, and fortunately we now have the computing power necessary to do it. We will see.
